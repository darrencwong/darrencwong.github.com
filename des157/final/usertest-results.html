        <h2>Unclear Exit Method</h2>
        <p>One significant observation was that not everyone immediately knew how to exit the info page back to the home page. The x close button was pretty small and since it was placed at the upper right corner of the paragraph, it makes sense that most people didn’t associate it with exiting the entire page. Some people tried to click the header text “Welcome To My Closet”, since that is a common UX principle employed on the web for returning to the home page. To address this issue, I plan to add a fairly large back arrow and place it on the upper left corner of the info page.  Since the information currently slides in the right, the arrow pointing left will make intuitive sense as a way to go back to the main page.</p>

        <h2>Hover Titles Styling</h2>
        <p>Another significant observation was people’s interaction with the hover titles. The feedback was varied, but the main issue seemed to be that the color of the text sometimes conflicted with the color of the t-shirt, since the title follows the user’s mouse movement. Some people also mentioned adjusting the placement of the text to create more balance within the design. On smaller screen sizes, the left side felt relatively empty compared to the right side, so the hover titles could possibly be moved to the left or alternate sides. I agree with most of this feedback and am thinking about changing the position of the hover title to prevent excessive overlap with the t-shirts. </p>

        <h2>Animations Well Loved</h2>
        <p>The third significant observation I made was that everyone really loved all the animations. After hitting enter on a relatively simple page, they were pleasantly surprised to see 6 t-shirts fall on screen. On top of that, the hover with the titles appearing and backgrounds changing color further added to the experience. Although the paragraph positioning wasn’t quite correct at the time, people still appreciated the slide animation and thought that the whole site greatly exemplified my personal connection with each t-shirt. Some suggestions that I definitely want to implement if I can manage in code is scaling or bouncing the t-shirts on hover to demonstrate that they are clickable. I was also interested in adding a zoom-in feature on the info page, but given time constraints and my limited coding abilities, I’m not sure how feasible that is before Thursday.</p>
