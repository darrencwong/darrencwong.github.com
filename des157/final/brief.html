        <h1>Project Brief</h1>

        <p>For my final project, I plan to further develop my “Every Picture” studio to create a more immersive user experience that tells a cohesive story.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
        <a href="https://juliecristobal.com/">Julie Cristobal</a>
        <p>I chose Julie Cristobal’s website as my first comparison site because it has similar transitions, organization, and content as what I planned on doing for my final project. While the site utilizes large animations, I think the smoothness and attention to detail in the small movements is really what sets it apart. The site’s clean interface and minimal use of text (except on hover) is another majorly successful aspect because it emphasizes the beautiful photography. One issue I ran into was when clicking on the images, it didn’t always load the next page. I also think that when you click on the image, there should be some description text, so the user has more context of the images.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
        <a href="https://www.g-star.com/en_us/elwood">G Star Elwood</a>
        <p>I chose G Star Elwood’s website as my second comparison site because it has a similar layout, organization, and content as what I planned on doing for my final project. The interactivity and attention to detail blew me away and really made the website feel more than a 2D screen. I like the option to choose between an organized grid or scattered interface on the main page and was impressed by all the layering of images and text as you scroll on the “discover” pages. Other than visuals, I encountered some issues with the user interface. Although the circular cursor and text on hover made it seem like you could click on each pair of jeans, you can’t do that unless you are on the overview tab. Even then, you still can’t click on the image and have to hit “discover” to bring up the page with more images and information. If you hit “women” or “men” above “discover”, the site doesn’t do anything, and you lose click control. </p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>The main goal for my final project is to create a more immersive user experience that tells a cohesive story of my graphic t-shirt collection by improving the layout, animations, and interactions. Based on my limited coding abilities, I’m uncertain if I can achieve the same quality level as the two aforementioned websites, but I am definitely inspired by their overall concepts. I think my scattered t-shirt layout will be similar to the G-Star Elwood explore page and the opening animation of Cristobal’s website. My website organization will also be similar because the home page will be scrollable between different t-shirt images, and when you click on one, the underlying story and possibly additional images will be provided. Unlike the two reference websites, I probably will not have as many animations or overlapping elements in my layout.</p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>For the website design, I plan to have the main page be vertically scrollable with scattered t-shirt images. Much like Cristobal’s site, I envision the layout to be simple, with a solid (maybe color changing on t-shirt hover) background, minimal text, and large images. The title of each shirt will display on hover. When the user clicks on a shirt, the next page will have the t-shirt laid out side by side with a description paragraph. To be honest, I’m not completely set on particular fonts or colors, but I think what I have now is pretty effective, so I might stick with fonts Staatliches and IBM Plex Sans and light blue for the background.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>When the user clicks “Enter” on the welcome screen, I’m ideally envisioning the heading text to move to the top left and the scattered t-shirts to slide down until the first t-shirt is showing. Upon hovering over each shirt, the shirt will grow and its name will appear, following the user’s mouse movement. All the shirts will share this interaction and be vertically laid out with scroll. When the user clicks on the t-shirt, everything will horizontally shift left off of the screen except for the t-shirt, and the paragraph description will slide in from the right. A back arrow will appear to bring back the vertical gallery.</p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>My ultimate goal when users visit this site is to create a joyful, immersive experience and tell compelling stories, similar to the feeling I got when I visited Julie Cristobal’s and G Star’s websites. If things go according to plan, the user will be led step by step through my t-shirt collection with different animations and transitions between pages. By the end of their website exploration, the users will hopefully be impressed, enjoy all of the interactions, and find interest in the t-shirt graphics and stories behind them.</p>
