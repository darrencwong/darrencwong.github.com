                <h2>Uniqlo + KAWS + Sesame Street Tee</h2>

                <p>This was one of the first tees I picked up when I first started familiarizing myself with streetwear and especially commercial artist KAWS. KAWS, or Brian Donnelly, has built himself an enormous name across fashion, art, and pop culture, and any of his collaborations resell for ridiculously high prices. This t-shirt in particular is a three way collaboration between Uniqlo, Sesame Street, and KAWS and features his signature take on Elmo, Bert, and Ernie. His own “Companion” character is also included in the back. A nice detail is KAWS’s signature XX logo embroidered in tonal white on the left sleeve. Because this was a collaboration with Uniqlo, the collection was relatively mass produced and easy to get. Also, Uniqlo graphic tees are $15, so how could I pass on that? I had to stop myself from buying the whole collection.</p>

                <h2>Vintage Jeff Gordon Tee</h2>
    
                <p>I’ve been a fan of NASCAR for a while, but I never really thought about getting any merch until I found out about vintage and unlocked an entire world of amazing NASCAR graphic tees. Because of my particular nature, especially when it comes to fashion, it took me months of online searching until I finally found this perfect t-shirt. The shirt has a beautiful graphic, features one of my favorite drivers Jeff Gordon, and was listed at a great price. The details, from the bling in the “Champion” text to the vibrant colors of the cars are incredible, and the print quality is pretty good for a shirt from the 90s!</p>

                <h2>Kelly Moore 25th Anniversary Tee</h2>
    
                <p>During Winter Break 2019, my friend and I took a trip to San Francisco to do some vintage shopping. In a semi-sketchy neighborhood, we decided to check out a random store, and after sifting through racks of random clothing, I found this gem. Well, it’s a gem to me at least. Kelly Moore isn’t a brand that I necessarily use, but having done paintings in the past, I felt a weird connection to it. My friend immediately questioned my purchase, but to me, the unexpected nature of Kelly Moore making a t-shirt is exactly why it’s special to me. You can’t just buy this stuff online. Also, as a car person, I definitely appreciate the truck airbrush-style artwork.</p>

                <h2>Hoonigan Gymkahan Ten Tee</h2>
        
                <p>One of my biggest inspirations in life is Ken Block, founder of DC Shoes and Hoonigan, rally driver, and creator of the world-famous Gymkhana video series. In these videos, he takes a high-horsepower, heavily-modified car and does unbelievable stunts in famous locations. All the Gymkhana videos have racked up hundreds of millions of views in total and have cemented Block as a celebrity in the car industry. This t-shirt is part of a collection that released alongside his tenth Gymkhana video. The back graphic features line art of the film’s 5 cars and subtle grey lightning bolts in each, representing the livery designed by Death Spray Custom. The right sleeve lists out the 5 iconic locations that the video was filmed in. As a fan, this was definitely a no-brainer purchase.

                <h2>Uniqlo + Takashi Murakami + Doraemon Tee</h2>

                <p>Takashi Murakami is a world-renowned pop artist, famous for his larger-than-life murals and extremely popular rainbow flower motif. I actually wasn’t even aware that he had done a collaboration with Uniqlo and Japanese anime series Doraemon until I stumbled across it in my local Uniqlo store, crumpled and stuffed in the back of an empty shelf. That was definitely a lucky find, and to this day, I’d say it's top 3 in my t-shirt collection. Even though I don’t know much about Doraemon, I love the playful art style, colors, and print texture of the graphic.</p>

                <h2>Diamond Supply Basquiat Tee</h2>

                <p>For the longest time, I’ve been trying to get a piece with Jean Michel Basquiat’s art to pair with my Keith Haring and Andy Warhol tees. However, everything I came across was either too expensive or didn’t visually appeal to me. On Instagram one day, I saw that skate brand Diamond Supply Co was doing a special collection with Basquiat’s art, and I loved the pieces, but the price range was way out of my budget. However, a few weeks later, I was randomly browsing on a skate shop website and came across this orange tee on sale! I love this graphic, and getting to see the actual artwork at The Broad was super cool.</p>
