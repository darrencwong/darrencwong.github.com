            <p>This reading was definitely very helpful in clearly defining applicable UX practices to follow when designing a form. Although most of the information seems fairly common sense and is often seen on well designed websites, I enjoyed reading the detailed explanations behind why one would make these design choices. The list format is also extremely helpful in making the information more digestible and memorable for later reference. </p>

            <p>Some of the tips that stand out to me are size fields accordingly, minimize drop down menus, providing matching keyboard, asking for sensitive information, and error message copy. Most forms I have interacted with usually have input boxes of equal length, but I do think adjusting the length will unconsciously prompt users to know what information should be inputted. When asking for sensitive information, I believe including the reason why is important because it provides some level of transparency that that information is actually needed or at least being used properly. Lastly, writing specific error messages will dramatically enhance the user experience by eliminating most of the frustration felt from a generic error message and letting the user know exactly what to fix.</p>
