            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>My goal for the site’s design is to make it look pretty subdued and minimal, with a dark mode feel. This puts the focus on the content and user interactions. For the collage of image submissions, I plan to use a grid layout.</p>

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>Ideally, I would like to incorporate a sliding animation between screens to make the whole data submission process feel seamless. I also want to make add button animations to provide feedback that it’s been clicked. The main interactions will be the user drawing over the image and clicking on other image submissions to expand them.</p>

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>I want users to have fun drawing on the image and seeing other user submissions, but feel a sense of dread seeing so many others draw how climate change will negatively affect our future. This will hopefully serve as a wake up call for action, which is included as the final step in my page.</p>
