            <h2><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/un-sounds-clarion-call-over-irreversible-climate-impacts-by-humans-2021-08-09/">Chestney, Nina, and Andrea Januta. “U.N. Climate Change Report Sounds 'Code Red for Humanity'.” Reuters, Thomson Reuters, 9 Aug. 2021, https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/un-sounds-clarion-call-over-irreversible-climate-impacts-by-humans-2021-08-09/.</a></h2>

            <p>In this article, authors Nina Chestney and Andrea Januta report on the U.N. climate panel’s recent landmark report warning that we are certain to face climate disruption for the next few decades and possibly centuries if drastic and immense changes are not made now. They also report on governments’ reactions to the report and explain how average temperatures are nearing the point of causing economic and social disorder. This source is very relevant to my project because it supports climate change as a severe issue that is and will affect us all. The authors don’t have much of a conclusion, but they discuss how further global warming could lead to record heat waves, drought, and other unforeseen consequences. After reading this article, I felt pretty depressed. I knew the situation was bad, but reading that scientists are projecting a grim future even if we start doing something now speaks to how terrible the situation really is.</p>

            <p>In this NBC article, author James Rainey provides a synopsis of two surveys gauging how American adults perceive climate change. Certain sections of this source are relevant to my project because the data emphasizes the overall inaction towards climate change. They say 73% of people are aware of climate change, which is an increase from the past, but Americans do not highly rate climate change as an urgent issue. 57% would support a $1/month fee, but if it rose to $10/month, only 28% would support it. The article ends by quoting Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, who blames President Trump’s strong skepticism of climate change for influencing Americans to think similarly. After reading this article, I’m convinced that people do take the issue seriously but not enough to implement change affecting their personal lives. </p>

            <h2><a href="https://hbr.org/2018/10/why-people-arent-motivated-to-address-climate-change"> Markman, Art. “Why People Aren't Motivated to Address Climate Change.” Harvard Business Review, 11 Oct. 2018, https://hbr.org/2018/10/why-people-arent-motivated-to-address-climate-change.</a></h2>

            <p>In this academic journal, author Art Markman explains why it’s difficult to motivate action against climate change. He attributes trade-offs between short term and long term benefits, climate change’s non-linearity, and distant effects as the three primary reasons. This journal is relevant to my project because it logically explains why inaction is so pervasive, which is my primary problem statement. Markman concludes by saying that if we live lavishly now, we have to accept that we are making selfish decisions, completely disregarding future generations. After reading this article, I agree with Markman but think many people will still be ok with making selfish decisions. </p>
