            <p>This website from NASA shows aerial images of different areas before and after the effects of climate change in recent areas. The middle slider line reveals a certain amount of each side based on user drag input, and the arrows on the side allow you to switch location. Overall, this site is a very interactive and unique experience that powerfully visualizes of climate change's effects and leaves a lasting impression on the users.</p>

            <p>Pixil is a free online drawing tool to create basic pixelated artwork. Though much more involved and complicated than what I intend to use for my final project, itâ€™s a good example of basic drawing, erasing, and saving. The layout is simple and straightforward, with the main focus on the canvas for easy drawing and all the essential tools on the left side bar. </p>
